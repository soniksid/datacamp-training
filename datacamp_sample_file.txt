Many new websites and online tools have come into existence to support
scholarly communication in all phases of the research workflow. To what extent
researchers are using these and more traditional tools has been largely
unknown. This 2015-2016 survey aimed to fill that gap. Its results may help
decision making by stakeholders supporting researchers and may also help
researchers wishing to reflect on their own online workflows. In addition,
information on tools usage can inform studies of changing research workflows.

The online survey employed an open, non-probability sample. A largely
self-selected group of 20663 researchers, librarians, editors, publishers and
other groups involved in research took the survey, which was available in seven
languages. The survey was open from May 10, 2015 to February 10, 2016. It
captured information on tool usage for 17 research activities, stance towards
open access and open science, and expectations of the most important
development in scholarly communication. Respondents’ demographics
included research roles, country of affiliation, research discipline and year of
first publication.
